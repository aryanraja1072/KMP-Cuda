# KMP-Cuda


# Meeting 1 Overview:
Last week, we implemented the serial code for KMP and ran it on a basic dataset, on the RAI server. Currently, we are working on the basic kernel for KMP. In the following weeks, we aim to improve the performance by making dynamic use of shared and constant memory for Longest Prefix Suffix table (size of the table decides the type of memory), and use of streams to overlap data loading and computations. Also, we would work on preparing a more comprehensive dataset to give better performance metrics.
